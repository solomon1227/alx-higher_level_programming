# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
```python```
*By **solomon Ferede** - sotware student at alx*
## Requirements to the project
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
### C Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
### More Info
Note: you do not need to understand lists yet.

## Files include in this project directory
- 0-positive_or_negative.py  3-print_alphabt.py - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
- 1-last_digit.py  - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number. 
- 2-print_alphabet.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.  
- 3-print_alphabt.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- 4-print_hexa.py - a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
- 5-print_comb2.py - a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
- 6-print_comb3.py - a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

- 100-print_tebahpla.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
- 101-remove_char_at.py - Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
- 102-magic_calculation.py - he Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
- lists.h - Header file containg prototype of function and stracture defination.
- README.md - A description about the project
